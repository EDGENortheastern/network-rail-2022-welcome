## Task 1

Code on GitHub is stored in repositories. Those are like folders.

To keep track of the versions of the code coders and data people use Git. Git is a version control software. It allows to go back in time, to a version that you had 2 hours ago, for example. GitHub is Git plus a place on the internet where your code folders are.

Have a look at the following reposittories:

- [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook)
- [Awesome Data Science](https://github.com/academic/awesome-datascience)
- [Dash sample apps](https://github.com/plotly/dash-sample-apps) - can you find how to access the gallery from the repo's landing page?

Try searching the entire github for Python projects. It is fine not to understand the code, the dots will connect.

## Task 2

Create your GitHub account. Make the name meaningful. Your GitHub is likely to stay wih your forever.
Find **Issues** on the main menu of this repository.
Create your first issue - ask me to add you to the project by providing your GitHub account name

## The end ðŸ”š
