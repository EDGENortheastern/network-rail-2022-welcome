Hello. This is GitHub, the place where coders store code and collaborate.

## Task 1

The code on GitHub is stored in repositories. Those are like folders.

To keep track of the versions of the code coders and data people use Git. Git is a version control software. For example, it allows you to go back in time to a version you had 2 hours ago. GitHub is Git plus a place on the internet where your code folders are.

Have a look at the following repositories:

- [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook)
- [Awesome Data Science](https://github.com/academic/awesome-datascience)
- [Dash sample apps](https://github.com/plotly/dash-sample-apps) - can you find how to access the gallery from the repo's landing page?

Try searching the entire GitHub for Python projects. It is fine not to understand the code or all of the GitHub controls. The dots will connect.

## Task 2

- Create your GitHub account. Make the name meaningful. Your GitHub is likely to stay with your forever.
- Find **Issues** on the main menu of this repository.
- Create your first issue - ask me to add you to the project by providing your GitHub account name. 

You can (and should) add emojis or labels to issues. One issue is there as an exmple.
